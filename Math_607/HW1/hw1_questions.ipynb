    "## The grader should be *able* to run your code, but shouldn't *need* to\n",
    "Despite the fact that you're providing code, I don't want the grader to be either *running* or *debugging* your code - and, indeed, shouldn't spent an inordinate amount of time *reading* it.  So:\n",
    "\n",
    "- at minimum, *say what your code is doing* in markdown blocks, not just in comments in the code;\n",
    "- submit a version of the worksheet which has results of one good run of the code (together with further pictures, data, explanations, ... as appropriate).\n",
    "- That said, the grader should be *able* to run your code!  make sure it runs in a reasonable amount of time on a normal computer, and don't use any weird libraries that we have to go searching for.\n",
    "- Write clear code, test it, and *include results of the tests*.  I'll say that again:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unit-test your  code and show us the tests\n",
    "- So, for instance: if you need to write a routine which factors integers, also write a test to see that it factors the integer 102 correctly.  Don't make the grader read your code and verify that you've actually implemented trial division.  And if the grader *does* need to do this: please use reasonable variable names, etc.\n",
    "- Consider doing *test-driven* development.  For instance:  Let's imagine you need to write an integer factorization routine for your assignment.  First, write the test that you've done it correctly:\n",

    "- If this isn't your first rodeo, go ahead and use a unit test framework that you like, as long as it's something standard and we don't have to be installing things on our computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leave time to refactor your code\n",
    "- If you tend to write unclear code, then go ahead and do that, get your simulations running, etc, but then tidy it up before you hand it in! i.e. *refactor* your code so that it is as above.\n",
    "- While refactoring, run your code frequently as you write; you know you're done when your tests are passing.  Also: if you wrote terrible code and you need to clean it up,  keep running the tests as you do that, so as to verify that everything is still working as intended.\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember: if you're unsure about your theoretical answer, check it with simulation! Probability is subtle and counterintuitive, whereas hacking away with python is not.  Partial credit will be given for empirical answers to theoretical questions (i.e. it is ok to try science in applied math class)  \n",
